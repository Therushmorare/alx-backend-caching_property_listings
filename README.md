Overview
This project implements a Django-based property listing application with Redis caching at multiple levels. The system demonstrates various caching strategies including view-level caching, low-level queryset caching, and proper cache invalidation techniques. The application uses Docker to containerize PostgreSQL for data persistence and Redis for caching, providing a realistic development environment that mirrors production setups.

Learning Objectives
Implement multi-level caching strategies in Django applications
Configure and integrate Redis as a cache backend
Set up containerized services (PostgreSQL and Redis) using Docker
Understand cache invalidation techniques using Django signals
Analyze cache performance metrics
Develop efficient database query patterns with caching
Structure Django projects for maintainability and scalability
Key Concepts
Multi-level Caching: Implementing both view-level and low-level caching
Cache Invalidation: Using Django signals to maintain cache consistency
Containerization: Managing dependencies with Docker containers
Cache Metrics: Monitoring and analyzing Redis cache performance
Database Optimization: Reducing database load through intelligent caching
Tools and Libraries
Django: Web framework for building the property listing application
PostgreSQL: Relational database for persistent storage
Redis: In-memory data store used for caching
Docker: Containerization platform for service management
django-redis: Django cache backend for Redis integration
psycopg2: PostgreSQL adapter for Python
Python‚Äôs logging: For tracking cache metrics and performance
Real-World Use Case
This project models a real estate listing platform where: 1. Property listings are frequently accessed but rarely modified 2. Database load needs to be minimized during peak traffic 3. Data consistency must be maintained despite caching 4. Performance metrics are monitored to optimize cache effectiveness

Such caching implementations are crucial for: - High-traffic listing platforms (real estate, e-commerce) - Applications with expensive database queries - Systems requiring sub-second response times - Platforms needing to scale efficiently under load

The techniques demonstrated provide a blueprint for building performant web applications while maintaining data consistency and reducing infrastructure costs.
